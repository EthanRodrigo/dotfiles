# AMANDINE

### Intro
This is my rice for the year 2022. Not the best, but I feel proud as this is better than the [last time](https://github.com/EthanRodrigo/dotfiles/tree/main/Esme). 

### What I have used?
- ***OS*** - **[Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/)** <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> I use Arch btw,
- ***Window Manager*** - **[Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/)** Love at first sight.
- ***Compositor*** - **[picom (jonaburg's fork)](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom)** Animation is cool.
- ***Bar*** - **Qtile bar** Why to use others when you have it at home? 
- ***Terminal*** - **[kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)** Fast and feature rich. 
- ***Shell*** - **[fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)** It's fast and highly customizable
                **[omf](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)**
                **[theme](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish)**
- ***Editor*** - **[neo-vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)** This is the first time and I'm loving it.
- ***File Manager*** - **[vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm)** I don't like GUI.
- ***Audio Visualizer*** - **[glava](https://github.com/jarcode-foss/glava/)** Better than others
- ***Music Player** - **[spotify (spiced up)](https://github.com/spicetify/)** Still don't pay for it.
\t\t\t**[theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/blob/master/THEMES.md#dribbblish)** Dribbblish
